This is the new year and I am still learning how to code. 

Today is 9 January 2025 and I am still learning how to code. I did tiktok assessment yesterday and it was pretty hard. 
I tried my best but could not solve even one problem and ended up using chat gpt at the very end. 
I don't like that but what can I do. I guess I'll just focus on bettering myself honing my knowledge and coding skills.
Like every other skills out there in the world I believe no matter how hard coding looks it is doable and I am gonna be software developer soon.
